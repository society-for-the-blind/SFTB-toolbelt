Very crude and very specific. It converts the contents of the files to a BASE64 string and the generated commands can be embedded. Probably not the brightest idea but the script can be altered pretty easily to exclude conversion and I needed this to whip up a single file HTML document that fills out the departmental template (only ./word/document.xml is changed, the rest stays as is).
